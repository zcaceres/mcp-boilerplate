## Getting started

1. [Create a new Google Cloud project](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate)
2. [Enable the Google Tasks API](https://console.cloud.google.com/workspace-api/products)
3. [Configure an OAuth consent screen](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent) ("internal" is fine for testing)
4. Add scopes `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/tasks`
5. [Create an OAuth Client ID](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/oauthclient) for application type "Desktop App"
6. Download the JSON file of your client's OAuth keys
7. Rename the key file to `gcp-oauth.keys.json` and place into the root of this repo (i.e. `gcp-oauth.keys.json`)

Make sure to build the server with either `npm run build` or `npm run watch`.

### Authentication

To authenticate and save credentials:

1. Run the server with the `auth` argument: `npm run start auth`
2. This will open an authentication flow in your system browser
3. Complete the authentication process
4. Credentials will be saved in the root of this repo (i.e. `.gdrive-server-credentials.json`)

### Usage with Desktop App

To integrate this server with the desktop app, add the following to your app's server configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gtasks": {
      "command": "/opt/homebrew/bin/node",
      "args": [
        "{ABSOLUTE PATH TO FILE HERE}/dist/index.js"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
